# How to add thread-level persistence (functional API)

!!! info "Prerequisites"

    This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
    
    - [Functional API](../../concepts/functional_api/.md)
    - [Persistence](../../concepts/persistence/.md)
    - [Memory](../../concepts/memory/.md)
    - [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/)

Many AI applications need memory to share context across multiple interactions on the same [thread](../../concepts/persistence#threads.md) (e.g., multiple turns of a conversation). In LangGraph functional API, this kind of memory can be added to any [entrypoint()][langgraph.func.entrypoint] workflow using [thread-level persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence).

When creating a LangGraph workflow, you can set it up to persist its results by using a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#basecheckpointsaver):


1. Create an instance of a checkpointer:

    ```python
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
    
    checkpointer = MemorySaver()       
    ```

2. Pass `checkpointer` instance to the `entrypoint()` decorator:

    ```python
    from langgraph.func import entrypoint
    
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def workflow(inputs)
        ...
    ```

3. Optionally expose `previous` parameter in the workflow function signature:

    ```python
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def workflow(
        inputs,
        *,
        # you can optionally specify `previous` in the workflow function signature
        # to access the return value from the workflow as of the last execution
        previous
    ):
        previous = previous or []
        combined_inputs = previous + inputs
        result = do_something(combined_inputs)
        ...
    ```

4. Optionally choose which values will be returned from the workflow and which will be saved by the checkpointer as `previous`:

    ```python
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def workflow(inputs, *, previous):
        ...
        result = do_something(...)
        return entrypoint.final(value=result, save=combine(inputs, result))
    ```

This guide shows how you can add thread-level persistence to your workflow.

!!! tip "Note"

    If you need memory that is __shared__ across multiple conversations or users (cross-thread persistence), check out this [how-to guide](../cross-thread-persistence-functional.md).

    If you need to add thread-level persistence to a `StateGraph`, check out this [how-to guide](../persistence.md).

## Setup

First we need to install the packages required


```
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

Next, we need to set API key for Anthropic (the LLM we will use).


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

## Example: simple chatbot with short-term memory

We will be using a workflow with a single task that calls a [chat model](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/).

Let's first define the model we'll be using:


```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
```

Now we can define our task and workflow. To add in persistence, we need to pass in a [Checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver) to the [entrypoint()][langgraph.func.entrypoint] decorator.


```python
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langgraph.graph import add_messages
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver


@task
def call_model(messages: list[BaseMessage]):
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return response


checkpointer = MemorySaver()


@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def workflow(inputs: list[BaseMessage], *, previous: list[BaseMessage]):
    if previous:
        inputs = add_messages(previous, inputs)

    response = call_model(inputs).result()
    return entrypoint.final(value=response, save=add_messages(inputs, response))
```

If we try to use this workflow, the context of the conversation will be persisted across interactions:

!!! note Note

    If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you __don't need__ to pass checkpointer to the entrypoint decorator, since it's done automatically.

We can now interact with the agent and see that it remembers previous messages!


```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "hi! I'm bob"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()
```

You can always resume previous threads:


```python
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()
```

If we want to start a new conversation, we can pass in a different `thread_id`. Poof! All the memories are gone!


```python
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in workflow.stream(
    [input_message],
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}},
    stream_mode="values",
):
    chunk.pretty_print()
```

!!! tip "Streaming tokens"

    If you would like to stream LLM tokens from your chatbot, you can use `stream_mode="messages"`. Check out this [how-to guide](../streaming-tokens.md) to learn more.
