# How to wait for user input (Functional API)

!!! info "Prerequisites"
    This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

    - Implementing [human-in-the-loop](../../concepts/human_in_the_loop.md) workflows with [interrupt](../../concepts/human_in_the_loop/#interrupt.md)
    - [How to create a ReAct agent using the Functional API](../../how-tos/react-agent-from-scratch-functional.md)

**Human-in-the-loop (HIL)** interactions are crucial for [agentic systems](../../concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop.md). Waiting for human input is a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the agent to ask the user clarifying questions and await input before proceeding. 

We can implement this in LangGraph using the [interrupt()][langgraph.types.interrupt] function. `interrupt` allows us to stop graph execution to collect input from a user and continue execution with collected input.

This guide demonstrates how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows using LangGraph's [Functional API](../../concepts/functional_api.md). Specifically, we will demonstrate:

1. [A simple usage example](#simple-usage.md)
2. [How to use with a ReAct agent](#agent.md)

## Setup

First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys:


```
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai
```


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

## Simple usage

Let's demonstrate a simple usage example. We will create three [tasks](../../concepts/functional_api/#task.md):

1. Append `"bar"`.
2. Pause for human input. When resuming, append human input.
3. Append `"qux"`.


```python
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt


@task
def step_1(input_query):
    """Append bar."""
    return f"{input_query} bar"


@task
def human_feedback(input_query):
    """Append user input."""
    feedback = interrupt(f"Please provide feedback: {input_query}")
    return f"{input_query} {feedback}"


@task
def step_3(input_query):
    """Append qux."""
    return f"{input_query} qux"
```

We can now compose these tasks in a simple [entrypoint](../../concepts/functional_api/#entrypoint.md):


```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()


@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def graph(input_query):
    result_1 = step_1(input_query).result()
    result_2 = human_feedback(result_1).result()
    result_3 = step_3(result_2).result()

    return result_3
```

All we have done to enable human-in-the-loop workflows is called [interrupt()](../../concepts/human_in_the_loop/#interrupt.md) inside a task.

!!! tip

    The results of prior tasks-- in this case `step_1`-- are persisted, so that they are not run again following the `interrupt`.


Let's send in a query string:


```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
```


```python
for event in graph.stream("foo", config):
    print(event)
    print("\n")
```

Note that we've paused with an `interrupt` after `step_1`. The interrupt provides instructions to resume the run. To resume, we issue a [Command](../../concepts/human_in_the_loop/#the-command-primitive.md) containing the data expected by the `human_feedback` task.


```python
# Continue execution
for event in graph.stream(Command(resume="baz"), config):
    print(event)
    print("\n")
```

After resuming, the run proceeds through the remaining step and terminates as expected.

## Agent

We will build off of the agent created in the [How to create a ReAct agent using the Functional API](../../how-tos/react-agent-from-scratch-functional.md) guide.

Here we will extend the agent by allowing it to reach out to a human for assistance when needed.

### Define model and tools

Let's first define the tools and model we will use for our example. As in the [ReAct agent guide](../../how-tos/react-agent-from-scratch-functional.md), we will use a single place-holder tool that gets a description of the weather for a location.

We will use an [OpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/openai/) chat model for this example, but any model [supporting tool-calling](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) will suffice.


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the weather from a specific location."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's sunny!"
    elif "boston" in location.lower():
        return "It's rainy!"
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"
```

To reach out to a human for assistance, we can simply add a tool that calls [interrupt](../../concepts/human_in_the_loop/#interrupt.md):


```python
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt


@tool
def human_assistance(query: str) -> str:
    """Request assistance from a human."""
    human_response = interrupt({"query": query})
    return human_response["data"]


tools = [get_weather, human_assistance]
```

### Define tasks

Our tasks are otherwise unchanged from the [ReAct agent guide](../../how-tos/react-agent-from-scratch-functional.md):

1. **Call model**: We want to query our chat model with a list of messages.
2. **Call tool**: If our model generates tool calls, we want to execute them.

We just have one more tool accessible to the model.


```python
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}


@task
def call_model(messages):
    """Call model with a sequence of messages."""
    response = model.bind_tools(tools).invoke(messages)
    return response


@task
def call_tool(tool_call):
    tool = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]]
    observation = tool.invoke(tool_call)
    return ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call["id"])
```

### Define entrypoint

Our [entrypoint](../../concepts/functional_api/#entrypoint.md) is also unchanged from the [ReAct agent guide](../../how-tos/react-agent-from-scratch-functional.md):


```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

checkpointer = MemorySaver()


@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def agent(messages, previous):
    if previous is not None:
        messages = add_messages(previous, messages)

    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Execute tools
        tool_result_futures = [
            call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in llm_response.tool_calls
        ]
        tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(messages, [llm_response, *tool_results])

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    # Generate final response
    messages = add_messages(messages, llm_response)
    return entrypoint.final(value=llm_response, save=messages)
```

### Usage

Let's invoke our model with a question that requires human assistance. Our question will also require an invocation of the `get_weather` tool:


```python
def _print_step(step: dict) -> None:
    for task_name, result in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # just stream from tasks
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        if task_name == "__interrupt__":
            print(result)
        else:
            result.pretty_print()
```


```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
```


```python
user_message = {
    "role": "user",
    "content": (
        "Can you reach out for human assistance: what should I feed my cat? "
        "Separately, can you check the weather in San Francisco?"
    ),
}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    _print_step(step)
```

Note that we generate two tool calls, and although our run is interrupted, we did not block the execution of the `get_weather` tool.

Let's inspect where we're interrupted:


```python
print(step)
```

We can resume execution by issuing a [Command](../../concepts/human_in_the_loop/#the-command-primitive.md). Note that the data we supply in the `Command` can be customized to your needs based on the implementation of `human_assistance`.


```python
human_response = "You should feed your cat a fish."
human_command = Command(resume={"data": human_response})

for step in agent.stream(human_command, config):
    _print_step(step)
```

Above, when we resume we provide the final tool message, allowing the model to generate its response. Check out the LangSmith traces to see a full breakdown of the runs:
