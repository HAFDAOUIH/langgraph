# How to stream from subgraphs

!!! info "Prerequisites"

    This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
    
    - [Subgraphs](../../concepts/low_level/#subgraphs.md)
    - [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/)

If you have created a graph with [subgraphs](../subgraph.md), you may wish to stream outputs from those subgraphs. To do so, you can specify `subgraphs=True` in parent graph's `.stream()` method:


```python
for chunk in parent_graph.stream(
    {"foo": "foo"},
    # highlight-next-line
    subgraphs=True
):
    print(chunk)
```

## Setup

First let's install the required packages


```
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph
```

## Example

Let's define a simple example:


```python
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict


# Define subgraph
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str


def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": "bar"}


def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + state["bar"]}


subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()


# Define parent graph
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str


def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}


builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
builder.add_node("node_2", subgraph)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
graph = builder.compile()
```

Let's now stream the outputs from the graph:


```python
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(chunk)
```

You can see that we're only emitting the updates from the parent graph nodes (`node_1` and `node_2`). To emit the updates from the _subgraph_ nodes you can specify `subgraphs=True`:


```python
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"foo": "foo"},
    stream_mode="updates",
    # highlight-next-line
    subgraphs=True,
):
    print(chunk)
```

Voila! The streamed outputs now contain updates from both the parent graph and the subgraph. **Note** that we are receiving not just the node updates, but we also the namespaces which tell us what graph (or subgraph) we are streaming from.
